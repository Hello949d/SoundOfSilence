        <p>In this year our job is to plan, design and construct a case for a holdable Bluetooth music box.</p>
        <p>We only have the electronics from the Bluetooth box and so we have to create the case how we want to.</p>

                <p>I looked over my CNC program with the teacher and corrected everything that wasn’t right. Then proceeded to wait to get on the CNC 5-Achses machine. In the afternoon the Machine was Being used by one of my partners Noah V. I helped him to the best of my abilities but in the end his program had some problems and we stayed 30 mins longer then we had to.</p>

                <p>In the morning I waited until the Machine was free In that time I looked over my program again so that I 100% sure that I have everything correct. In the meantime the Machine got free I quickly played my program on the Machine and with some starting help from Noah V. I began to milling the program ran good but in the middle of the part being made we hade to go to the photo shooting I panicked a bit because I didn’t know how to temporarily stop the program but after Simon showed it to me I quickly had the photo taken and got back on to milling. The rest of the program went good except the threads, I had to recut them in the after noon after that I looked over my over programs and made them ready for next week.</p>

After I was done I went to the CAD room and proceeded to 3D print my lid I had some problems at the start but I quickly got it and now it is printing.</p>

I did that for 3,5 hours, after that I was pretty much finished with every program, I went to the CAD room to redo my 3D-print. When I finished setting up the 3D-print it was lunch break. In the afternoon I waited until one CNC machine was free, but it never was, so I took the free time and looked over the programs again and helped some fellow students.</p>

                <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p>
                <p>In the beginning I went directly to the CNC Machin and began to look over my program and started to fix the small problems there were. After fixing it I did the dry run and after that I played the program and started to make my handle without much problem. And with that I had alle prats for the music box finished. The only thing I still need are the screws.</p>

The teacher said that my program was fine, so I put in a new one. My program worked good, until I noticed that the tap didn’t make his job right.

                <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p>
                <p>In the morning, I finished all the programs for the CNC turning machine. I put all the tools I need to the machine, but there wasn’t enough time to make my first piece.</p>

                <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p>
                <p>I wrote this blog and worked on the cost calculation, after that I worked on my drawings in design, because there isn’t that much time to get finished.</p>

                <p><strong>Thursday</strong></p>
                <p>I worked on my drawings in design the hole day.</p>

                <p>On Monday in the morning, I produced the feeds for my music box and finished so my penultimate piece for my box. So I can see the finish line.</p>

                <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p>
                <p>Tuesday was a very busy day. I produced my last piece from the holdable Bluetooth music box, the holder. After that I built all the pieces together to check if all the parts fit together and it worked! Then in the afternoon I soldered the wire to the speakers. Now I only need the screws to finish my box.</p>

                <p>Now there is only one job left we have to do in the Betriebspraktikum, the advertising video in German. Now I only have to work on the drawings in design, that’s really hard work.</p>

                <p>On Monday we had our first day in the workshop. I programmed the CNC-Milling program, to produce my first milling component.</p>

                <p>On Monday we were back in the workshop. There I checked my program again for errors. Then I programmed the second side of my workpiece.</p>

                <br><br>
                <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p>
                <p>Today I loaded my first program onto the machine. Then I measured tools and stored them in the CNC milling machine. The program worked perfectly, even if it was tight a few times. But I made a mistake and had a D3.2 drill in the machine instead of a D4.2 drill. I then replaced this and was then able to mill my 2 parts without any errors.</p>

                <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p>
                <p>On Wednesday I continued working on my 3D model of the music box. I added more details and also drew the mounting of the electronics. Then I 3D printed my holder, which connects the handle to the rest of the music box, with Michael Auer and Noah Völlenkle.</p>

                <p><strong>Thursday</strong></p>
                <p>We noticed in the morning that the 3D printer wasn't working properly. Because of this, the printer only printed the first layer and then stopped printing. So we cleaned the printer again. But because we couldn't get the printer working again, we changed the printer. After that, everything worked perfectly. Then I continued working on my design. I also increased the overall size of the music box because otherwise it would be a bit too short.</p>

                <p><strong>Monday</strong></p>
                <p>On Monday I checked my milling part program again and then put my part on the machine. To do this I had to swap the normal center clamp for a 3-jaw chuck because my clamping surface was round. I had to be very careful not to crush my thin workpiece, but it worked out well. After all of that I started a 3D printer to print the main part of my music box.</p>

                <br><br>
                <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p>
                <p>Today I did all the remaining little things on my milled piece. I deburred all the sharp edges and re-cut the threads. Then I went to the 3D printer and got my finished printed part, which I started the day before. I had to remove all the support material and file everything to the right size so that all the individual parts fit together. I also removed the corners from my speaker so that it had the right shape and size so that I could clamp it properly into my music box. I also assembled the electronics and tested them out.</p>

                <br><br>
                <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p>
                <p>On Wednesday I made another slight change to the cover of my music box. I enlarged all the holes that needed a thread so that I could then put a thread insert in them. I then selected the thread inserts I wanted, and measured them.</p>

But because we only had the morning in the turning shop today and another class was there in the afternoon, we didn't have much time and unfortunately I didn't get around to making it. Due to a printing error, I had to 3D print the "Halter" again. Then I started assembling my music box. I installed the technology and soldered the cables.</p>
